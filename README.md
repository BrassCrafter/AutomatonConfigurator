# Goal
Creating automatons based on configurations set in the config.properties file
# To-Dos
# Creating a adjustable Automaton
-  configurable number of states => Storable in arrays (final amount of states) => indexable
-  configurable alphabet => also storable in an array (final amount of states)
-  configurable connections between states => List of following states might also be final => array would also be an option
-  maybe differ between NEA and DEA automaton method (NEA method should work also on DEA) => Lists, because of continuously changing (amount of) content.
# Connecting configuration with config.properties file
-  How do I read and write on a .properties file?
-  Syntax of the .properties file?
# GUI?
-  Maybe display the automaton
-  Make fields to configure the automaton to prevent errors due to false syntax in the .properties file.
